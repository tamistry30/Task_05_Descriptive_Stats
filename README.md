As part of this research task, I challenged ChatGPT (a Large Language Model) to answer natural language questions about the SU Women’s Lacrosse dataset using only small table snippets. The results were tracked for accuracy, clarity, and any required prompt engineering.

> ```

**LLM Response:**  
> Both offense and defense worsened in 2025. The bigger drop was in offense (goals/game down by nearly 3), so the coach should prioritize improving offense.

**Result:**  
Correct, logical answer.

## Prompt Engineering Insights

- **Simple tabular prompts led to correct answers.**
- For reasoning questions, providing summary stats or clarifying what to compare led to detailed and accurate responses.
- When asked open-ended questions, the LLM sometimes needed clarification on what metric to use, especially for “most improved player” or similar queries.

## Conclusion

When given clear, relevant data in a small table, ChatGPT answered all six research questions about the SU Women’s Lacrosse season accurately and logically, requiring little to no additional prompt engineering.
